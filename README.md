# Detect sarcasm with deep learning

I have used a bidirectional LSTM to predict the sarcasm in a kaggle news dataset. A comparison between the various embedding techniques too have been made.Achieved around 80% accuracy.

I faced issues while tuning the model, tried some permutations of hyperparameters to enhance the results and was successful to some extent.
By using hyperas for model tuning, a good set of parameters could be achieved.
